Use Genius API to get metadata and lyrics about songs.

Contributors: Roquentin, batlab.

## Setup

All settings must be done in `main.R`. You HAVE to get a genius.com access
token, and paste it into the `main.R` file.

If some required packages are not installed on your system, `genius.R`
should automatically install missing packages ;-)

Then all that's needed is to source the main file :

```
source('main.R')
```

And you're set !
